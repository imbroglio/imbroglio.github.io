I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://saasweb.hku.hk) within the [School of Computing and Data Science](https://www.cds.hku.hk) at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk).
I obtained my Ph.D. in Actuarial Science from the University of Waterloo under the supervision of [Prof. Mario Ghossoub](https://sites.google.com/site/marioghossoub).

My current research focuses on studying how risk is allocated among different agents within an economic framework. Specifically, I study the structure of Pareto optima and market equilibria, as they are affected by different models of agent preferences, market structure, etc. I am broadly interested in quantitative risk management and its intersections with economics and mathematical finance.

I am an [Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA)](https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/edu-asa-req) and am currently pursuing fellowship.
